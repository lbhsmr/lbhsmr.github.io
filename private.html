				<h3>Sehr baby,</h3>

				<p><strong>Happy 19th birthday!</strong></p>

				<p>
					You’ve been looking forward to this day with a mix of anticipation and anxiety, so I wonder how you’re feeling right now. In any case, just remember that today is a day to be enjoyed! It’s a special day and it’s your day, and if you stepped back and took a long hard look you might see that the world is not scary, that life is beautiful and worth enjoying, even if for a moment. My literary instincts have eroded since I stopped writing consistently, so let someone more capable rephrase this:
				</p>

				<div class="quote">
					<p>
						“We don’t understand that life is heaven, for we only have to understand that and it will at once be fulfilled in all its beauty, we shall embrace each other and weep”
					</p>
					<p style="text-align: right">
						- Fyodor Dostoevsky, <em>The Brothers Karamazov</em>
					</p>
				</div>

				<p>
					It may be optimistic, but, once again, it is <em>because I am with you</em> that I can be so optimistic.
				</p>

				<p>
					Now, you see, I’m not someone who is used to writing love letters. So, I decided after long hard thought (and many stumbling starts - writing paragraphs in my mind only to discard them), that I’d just do it the way that feels the most natural.
				</p>

				<p>
					So let me begin with some philosophy, because it has been one of my hobbies since that period last year when I devoured textbooks from Bertrand Russell’s <em>History of Modern Philosophy</em> to masterpieces like Dostoevsky’s <em>Notes From Underground</em>. Today the subject will be something that I have had a complicated relationship with - <strong>love</strong>.
				</p>

				<p>
					As with most other adolescents, it began as a mysterious entity, shrouded behind that veneer of naivety which makes it exciting and alluring. In time I learnt its many dimensions and the ways it can be expressed. Yet of course my initial forays only grazed the surface, and I never appreciated the depths of this entity.
				</p>

				<p>
					I also learnt, quickly enough - perhaps much quicker than most others - that love <em>wounds</em> you, more deeply than many other things can. I liken this to a boy who swam in the idyllic waters of a shallow pond tucked away within magical, flourishing greenery, who was without warning plunged into the malevolent currents of the violent ocean that ravaged the sailors of <em>Moby Dick</em>. I suppose it hit me hard because I was immature, unprepared. But I will not dwell on that for too long - if you have read On Love, you’ll appreciate what I mean here.
				</p>

				<p>
					I suppose you can understand that it was a difficult and frightening decision for me to enter into a relationship again, with you. Of course a part of me was scared, that child who did not want to be hurt again.
				</p>

				<p>
					But - and the main point arrives - I am blessed that I did. Because, in the months that I have been with you, I have come to understand, very happily, a new ontological paradox that love has thrusted upon me: that it can be as beautiful as it can be painful. You have taught me that within me there was the capacity to experience feelings of longing and tenderness as intense as I do now for you. Indeed, you showed me a new dimension of this world; In the moments of irrational exuberance you inspire in this <em>mentat</em>, you told me, wordlessly, exactly what I have told you at the start: that life is beautiful and worth living.
				</p>

				<p>
					I can wax eloquent all I like about impressive-sounding dogmas and ideals, but I would also like to talk about some of the small things that you’ve done that were etched in my memory, that mean more to me than you may think.
				</p>

				<ul>
					<li>Buying me ice cream, and letting me have the last of it.
					<li>Giving me kisses on my face, chest and arms, and staining my skin with your lipstick.
					<li>Waking me up by giving me a kiss, and a tender hug that made me feel loved and comforted.
					<li>Assuring me that my internship would be alright and that I was worrying too much.
					<li>Not being picky about where we eat, letting me make the choices, and having trust in me when I find the way.
					<li>Telling me about your daily life, like what you are cooking or baking, the flowers you have in your backyard, the shows you’re watching.
					<li>Always saying good nights.
					<li>Wishing me a safe flight, and even before we were together, a happy birthday.
				</ul>

				<p>
					And, on top of all that, the bigger things - sending me the letter, coming all the way over to my dorm, choosing my clothes for me. I want you to know that I see the effort behind each of these, the meticulousness you put in and the love you show through these actions. I want you to know that I cherish you very dearly.
				</p>

				<p>I know that you tire of reading, so let me end off here. So:</p>

				<p>My beautiful, charming, dazzling baby,</p>

				<p>I wish you a wonderful and happy birthday,</p>

				<p>And all the love in the world that your kind, angelic soul deserves.</p>

				<p>I love you, I adore you, and I miss you.</p>
